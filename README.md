### 🚀 About Me

I’m a software engineer based in **New York City** (OPT/STEM OPT valid till May 2028).  
Graduated with a **Master’s in Computer Science from NYU (3.8/4.0 GPA)** and a **Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai**.

I like designing and building **robust, scalable backend systems** — usually around **Python, Java, FastAPI, Spring Boot, and AWS**.  
Right now, I’m working as **Founding Engineer & CTO at Novum AI**, building an AI-powered call center assistant that listens, analyzes, and guides sales reps in real time.  

If I had to describe my engineering philosophy: clean code, strong documentation, and no features without purpose.

### 💡 What I’m Working On

- **Novum AI** – architecting an AI-powered call center platform using **AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, WebSockets**, and **AssemblyAI**  
  → added encryption, webhook signature verification, rate limiting, and a CI/CD pipeline with AWS SAM.  
  → reduced latency and added real-time analytics dashboards for live calls.  
  → monthly infra cost under $100 while supporting concurrent users.

- **Home Store (Microservices E-Commerce)** – built a multi-tenant e-commerce backend using **Spring Boot + Spring Cloud + Docker**  
  → designed modular microservices (product, cart, order, store), each with its own database and REST API.  
  → uses **Eureka service discovery** and **API Gateway** for scale.

- **FlashBids** – real-time auction platform that prevents last-second sniping  
  → used **Flask, Redis Pub/Sub, DynamoDB, WebSockets**  
  → optimized Redis with connection pooling; reduced latency by 30%.

- **VibeCheck (NYU Project)** – paired users based on Spotify listening data  
  → backend in **Django + Redis**, deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** with **Travis CI**, achieved 87% test coverage.

### 🧠 How I Work

- I prefer **documented, linted, and readable code**.  
- I always plan architecture before writing functions.  
- I explain complex ideas with small working examples.  
- I believe debugging is not just about fixing — it’s about understanding.

---

### 🌱 Learning & Interests

- **Go Language** – currently learning it after Microsoft’s TypeScript-compiler rewrite in Go  
- **Mobile Development** – interested in how mobile + cloud ecosystems are merging  
- **Security** – I’m that person who adds input validation before the first commit

### 🎯 Career Goals

**Short-term (1-2 years):**
- Work on distributed, production-scale systems
- Write production-grade Go code
- Strengthen cloud-security and system-design skills  

**Long-term (3-5 years):**

### 💬 Fun Side

Outside of code, I read manga (One Piece, Bleach, One Punch Man), play cricket, and love connecting with people from different backgrounds — I was that guy in school who somehow fit into every friend group.
