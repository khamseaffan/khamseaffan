### 🚀 About Me

I’m a software engineer based in **New York City** with a **Master’s in Computer Science from NYU (3.8/4.0 GPA)**.

**Work Authorization:**
* 🇺🇸 **USA:** F-1 OPT/STEM OPT (Valid until May 2028)
* 🇬🇧 **UK:** High Potential Individual (HPI) Visa Eligible (No sponsorship required for 2 years)

I specialize in the **0-to-1 build phase**: taking complex architectural problems and turning them into scalable, production-grade systems using **Python (FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot), and AWS**.

Currently, I serve as **Founding Engineer at Novum AI**, where I architected the entire backend infrastructure for a real-time AI sales assistant from scratch.

### 💡 Featured Projects

#### 🎙️ [Novum AI](https://novum-ai.com) (Founding Engineer)
*Architected an AI-powered call center platform handling real-time audio analysis.*
- **The Challenge:** Process live audio streams with <1s latency while managing costs.
- **The Stack:** AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, WebSockets, AssemblyAI.
- **The Impact:**
    - Reduced end-to-end latency to **sub-900ms** for live transcription.
    - Implemented **security hardening** (Webhook signature verification, Rate Limiting).
    - Optimized infra costs to **<$100/mo** while supporting concurrent users via Serverless architecture.

#### 🛍️ Home Store (Microservices E-Commerce)
*A multi-tenant e-commerce backend designed for modularity and failure isolation.*
- **The Architecture:** Decomposed monolith into 4 distinct microservices (Product, Cart, Order, Identity) using **Spring Boot** & **Docker**.
- **Key Tech:** Eureka Service Discovery, API Gateway, Resilience4j (Circuit Breakers).
- **Outcome:** Decoupled deployment cycles, allowing independent scaling of the 'Order' service during high-load simulation.

#### ⚡ FlashBids (High-Concurrency Auction Platform)
*Real-time auction engine designed to prevent "sniping" and race conditions.*
- **The Tech:** Python (Flask), **Redis Pub/Sub**, WebSockets.
- **Performance:** Optimized Redis connection pooling to reduce latency by **30%**, ensuring fair bid ordering for 1,000+ concurrent simulated users.

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I don't just write code; I design systems.
- **Production First:** "It works on my machine" is not a valid status. I build with CI/CD and containerization from day one.
- **Security by Design:** Input validation, RBAC, and rate limiting are not afterthoughts—they are architectural requirements.
- **Bias for Action:** I prefer shipping a clean MVP and iterating over over-engineering a perfect ghost town.
